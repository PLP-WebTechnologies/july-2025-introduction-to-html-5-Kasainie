        SEO & Metadata:
        The meta tags below are crucial for search engines to understand the page.
        The `charset` ensures proper character display, `viewport` makes the page
        responsive on different devices, and the `description` is a key factor
        for search engine rankings.

    <!--
        HTML5 Semantic Structure:
        The document is divided into logical sections using semantic tags.
        These tags (header, nav, main, article, footer, etc.) provide
        meaning and context to the content for both browsers and assistive
        technologies like screen readers.
    -->

    <header>
        <!--
            The `header` element represents the introductory content of the page.
            The `<h1>` tag is the most important heading, defining the main
            subject of the entire page for both users and search engine crawlers.
        -->
        <h1>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio</h1>
        <nav>
            <!--
                The `nav` element signifies a section containing navigation links.
                Screen readers can easily identify this as a primary navigation menu.
            -->
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#about-me">About Me</a></li>
                <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
        <!--
            The `main` element holds the unique and primary content of the page.
            There should only be one `main` element per document.
        -->

        <section id="about-me">
            <!--
                The `section` element groups related content. The `id` attribute
                allows for direct linking from the navigation menu.
            -->
            <h2>About Kasaine Lekireu</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Kasaine Lekireu. I am a passionate and dedicated individual focused on building
                web experiences that are not only functional but also accessible to everyone. My journey began with
                an interest in clean code and a desire to create a more inclusive web.
                I believe that a strong foundation in HTML5 semantics is the first step towards building robust,
                future-proof websites.

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>Here are some of my recent projects:</p>

            <article>
                <!--
                    The `article` tag represents a self-contained composition in a document.
                    It can be distributed independently, like a blog post or a news article.
                    Each project is a good example of an `article`.
                -->
                <h3>Project One: Accessible Landing Page</h3>
                <p>
                    A landing page built from scratch, focusing exclusively on using correct HTML5 semantic tags
                    to ensure maximum accessibility and readability for screen readers.
                </p>
                <!--

                <p>
                    An experiment in creating a blog post layout using only semantic HTML5 tags like
                    `<header>`, `<figure>`, `<blockquote>`, and `<p>`, without any CSS.
                </p>

        <aside id="contact">
            <!--
                The `aside` element contains content that is tangentially related

            or for the entire page. It often contains copyright information,
            contact info, or links to related documents.
